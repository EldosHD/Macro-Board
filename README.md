## Quick Introduction

placeholder

my friend is working on [another version](https://github.com/TimeElysium/secondKeybordShortcuts) that is based on my original framwork

## To Do

- create an "type" in hotkeys.json for every function in std and stdExtensions
- port all current hotkeys to the hotkeys.json file
- add an easy way to send text (e.g. in a game chat)  (with option for multiple games?!)
- finish readme

## Installation

IÂ´ll probably write an installer script for that. But for now, here are the basic instructions:

1. Download the code an extract it to ur fav location.
2. install luamacros
3. run the `SECOND_KEYBOARD_script_for_LUA_MACROS.lua` with luamacros
4. read the comments in that script and change the keyboardidentifier as ur told
5. change the location of the `keypressed.txt` file both in the `mainlistener.py` and `SECOND_KEYBOARD_script_for_LUA_MACROS.lua` file to a location you want.
6. start `SECOND_KEYBOARD_script_for_LUA_MACROS.lua` and `mainlistener.py`
7. enjoy
